Facts
In this project, I am playing the role of a BI Consultant hired by Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey. I have been hired to help the restaurant use data to improve operation.

The Dataset

1)Contains 4 tables in CSV format
2)The Orders table contains the date & time that all table orders were placed
3)The Order Details table contains the different pizzas served with each order in the Orders table, and their quantities
4)The Pizzas table contains the size and price for each distinct pizza in the Order Details table, as well as its
    broader pizza type
5)The Pizza Types table contains details on the pizza types in the Pizzas table, including their name as it appears on
    the menu, the category it falls under, and its list of ingredients
Problem Statement
Find opportunities to drive more sales, and improve work efficiency. Some of the questions that need to be answered are:

1) What days and times we tend to be the busiest?
2) How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
3) What are the best and worst selling pizzas?
4) What's our average order value?
5) How well are we utilizing our seating capacity?
Primary Objective:
Analyze the data and put together to help find opportunities to drive more sales and improve work efficiency.
Secondary Objectives:

3) Identify the best and worst selling pizzas;
4) Calculate average order value;

6) Create a single-page visual
